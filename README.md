Git is evil and forces some extra commits sometimes, therefore the commit stats are not entirely right.

Our database environment is weird, so in order to obtain data from the database we constantly need to restart the server. 
We've asked for help, searched for solutions but nothing works. Instead of using hard coded data, we restart the server 
(since the database actually is working).



LOLWUT!? By adding jquery from REST-workshop Alexander somehow got about 25k additions!? Supervisors: please do NOT care 
about these weird git-stats!
