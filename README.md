Git forces some extra commits sometimes, therefore the commit stats are not entirely right.

By adding jquery from REST-workshop Alexander somehow got about 25k additions!? Supervisors: please do NOT care 
about these weird git-stats!


Our database environment is weird, so in order to obtain data from the database we constantly need to restart the server. 
We've asked for help, searched for solutions but nothing works. Instead of using hard coded data, we restart the server 
(since the database actually is working).

The somtimes is a problem with the database when trying to access all a customers sell- and buy auctions.
